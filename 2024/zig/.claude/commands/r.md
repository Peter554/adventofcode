I'm working on Advent of Code 2024 in Zig.

I'm using the 0.16 dev release of Zig, find docs at https://ziglang.org/documentation/.
Likely some APIs will have changed since you trained.

Review the solution code for day $1. 

Provide concise feedback on:
* What I've done well.
* Quality of the Zig code. Is it correct and idiomatic?
* Ways to solve the puzzle better. Methodological or algorithmic concerns.
* Ways to simplify the implementation.

You can run the tests with `zig build test -Dday={day}` (e.g. `zig build test -Dday=1` for day 1).
